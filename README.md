# Wind Waker: Tower of the Gods Beam Effect

[View the project on carvacodes.github.io](https://carvacodes.github.io/?project=tower-of-the-gods).

A piece inspired by one of my favorite games, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. This beam effect appears in a cinematic section where the Tower of the Gods erupts from the sea.
